2. Hadoop 2.7.0

Executing Jobs:
1. Install maven if you haven't already.
1. Checkout the project.
2. Create jar file by executing:
```mvn clean package```. This will generate jar file under ```target``` folder.
3. run the ```submitjobs.sh``` script available in project's root folder. MapReduce jobs' outputs will be available in ```output``` folder under project's root folder.
